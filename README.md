# Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Journey** repository! This space highlights my hands-on learning path through essential Python libraries—from data manipulation to model building.

##  Completed Notebooks

| Library       | Description                                              | File                                |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **Pandas**     | Explored data processing, cleaning, and manipulation      | `pandas-exercises.ipynb`            |
| **NumPy**      | Learned numerical computing fundamentals                  | `numpy-exercises.ipynb`             |
| **Matplotlib** | Created visualizations to interpret and present data      | `matplotlib-exercises.ipynb`        |

##  What’s Next

The upcoming milestone is **Scikit-Learn** — where I’ll start building machine learning models and sharpen my skills in classification, regression, and more.

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:  
   ```bash
